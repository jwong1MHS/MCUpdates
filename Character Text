The genius founder of Stark Industries, and an inventor who once focused his efforts on creating advanced weapons to sell to any military buyer. However, after finding himself held captive by terrorists who used his weapons, his worldview changed and he focused on trying to protect others instead of harming them. To do this, Tony invented the Iron Man suit, a high-tech armor with countless weapons that he constantly improves upon to help him fight against evil. Ever cocky and brash, Tony often makes mistakes that he finds himself needing to correct, but in the end, everything he does is with the intent of doing what he is right.

Once a scrawny kid growing up in Brooklyn during the 1900s, Steve always wanted to join the army to help serve his country. When he is given the chance to do just that by becoming a Super Soldier injected with a serum to make him stronger than any average man, he accepts and becomes Captain America. However, one mission led to an accident where he crashed into the ice and was preserved there for seventy years, leading to his eventual discovery and return to the modern day. Always an idealist who only does what he thinks is right because he thinks is right, Steve is a true patriot who will do anything to protect the people he cares for, his country, and the world.


Bruce Banner: 
Portrayed by: Mark Ruffalo (previously by Edward Norton)
Appears in: The Incredible Hulk, The Avengers, Iron Man 3, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Thor: Ragnarok, Avengers: Infinity War, Captain Marvel, Avengers: Endgame
Bruce was a nuclear physicist performing tests involving immunity to radiation; in his efforts, he tested on himself with the consequence of gaining an alter ego known as The Hulk, a violent, super powerful personality that can come out whenever Bruce's anger reaches a certain high threshold. While he had attempted to keep this side of him at bay, by going into isolation he has accepted that it can be used for good instead of harm by means of smashing any bad guys. Bruce and Hulk are polar opposites; while the former is meek, careful, and intelligent, the latter is a stupid, reckless creature bent on destruction.

Thor: 
Portrayed by: Chris Hemsworth
Appears in: Thor, The Avengers, Thor: The Dark World, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Thor: Ragnarok, Avengers: Infinity War, Avengers: Endgame
The Norse God of Thunder himself, he was raised by Odin with his brother Loki. One day, Thor's recklessness in battle led to Odin banishing him to Earth as a lesson in humility. After meeting Jane Foster and Eric Selvig, and learning about human life, Thor mellows out and returns to Asgard as a proper hero and heir to the throne. With his hammer Mjolnir and control over lightning, Thor is far more powerful than the average human, and certainly a force to be reckoned with. While he had become more kind during his time on Earth, Thor is still incredibly prideful and unthoughtful, and if anything, his time with the Avengers only helped this part of him become more prominent.

Natasha Romanoff: 
Portrayed by: Scarlett Johansson
Appears in: Iron Man 2, The Avengers, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Captain America: Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War, Captain Marvel, Avengers: Endgame
An agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., and the byproduct of an amoral, brutal training program for her and other young girls. In spite of this, or perhaps as a result of this, Natasha still chooses to fight for good, doing so as an agent that keeps watch on any potentially dangerous individuals. She is an experienced fighter in both hand-to-hand combat and firearms, and has a personality that can flip from sarcastic and playful to concentrated and serious on a moment's notice based on what the situation requires.

Clint Barton: 
Portrayed by: Jeremy Renner
Appears in: Thor, The Avengers, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Captain America: Civil War, Avengers: Endgame
An agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. and outstanding marksman, not much was initially known about Clint's past. However, he in fact has a wife and two (later three) kids that live in a secluded farm to keep them out of harm's way, which is a constant presence as an agent. He was the one to recruit Natasha into S.H.I.E.L.D. after being tasked with killing her; after he spared her, the two formed an incredibly close bond. Definitely the most down to Earth member of the Avengers, Clint always keeps a level head and acts as a support for a number of members of the team, especially Wanda Maximoff.

Thor's adopted brother and the God of Mischief. The son of an Ice Giant slain by Odin, the latter took Loki in as his son and raised him as his own. However, Odin's preference towards Thor created a sense of resentment in Loki, not helped by him learning of his true lineage. After this point, Loki has gone back and forth from good and evil, but most everything he does is in favor of himself in some way. Extremely cunning and proficient in illusion magic, Loki always has a way to fool others, which is further helped by his charismatic personality.
