                An agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. and outstanding marksman, not much was initially known about Clint's past. 
                However, he in fact has a wife and two (later three) kids that live in a secluded farm to keep them out of harm's way, which is a constant presence as an agent. 
                He was the one to recruit Natasha into S.H.I.E.L.D. after being tasked with killing her; after he spared her, the two formed an incredibly close bond. 
                Definitely the most down to Earth member of the Avengers, Clint always keeps a level head and acts as a support for a number of members of the team, especially Wanda Maximoff.
