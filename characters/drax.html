                Drax was once an ordinary, kind husband and father; that all changed when his wife and daughter were murdered by Ronan the Accuser, and since then, he has been a bloodthirsty psychopath out for vengence. 
                Irrational and dangerous, it took teaming up with Quill and the other Guardians to get him to mellow out.
