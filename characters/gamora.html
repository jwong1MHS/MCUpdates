                The adopted daughter of the Mad Titan Thanos, Gamora was raised with the sole purpose of becoming a warrior. 
                After being arrested with Quill, Rocket, and Groot, and escaping with Drax in tow, Gamora began to work against her father along with her new allies. 
                Cold and ruthless, it takes a long time for Gamora to warm up to those around her, including the people who eventually became her teammates.
